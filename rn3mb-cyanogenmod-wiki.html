                            <p> Here ( is the wiki guide. I can't tell if the rooting instructions are gone, or if it is telling me that clockworkMod recovery will automatically root my phone. Currently I am running ubuntu with no Android SDK installed. If this guide is complete, I can root the phone without any help from the computer at all. Is this the case, or is this an incomplete guide? Thanks. So I got sick of the Kindle UI on my Kindle Fire HD (7") and I wanted to get CyanogenMod on it. So I rooted it, and then went to this page: But OH NOES, the wiki is marked incomplete. So a little bit of Googling I came up with this: And encountered more roadbumps, like the process saying "Waiting for device" because it won't go into fastboot. Anyone more knowledgeable I was browsing the internet and I stumbled across a web archive containing the old cyanogenmod wiki and I was impressed to see a really detailed guide on porting roms. In my opinion it is exactly the sort of thing lineage needs for their wiki and I was wondering if there is any chance this guide could make its way onto the lineage website.

Over the past couple days I've been working on archiving all the CM sites amp downloads, and I'm pleased to say I've got (mostly) everything. I have successfully obtained. I have a samsung galaxy note 3 us cellular. Model #: SM-N900R4. It comes preloaded with a lot of usc preloaded shit that i would like to remove completely, but cant because fuck the end user amiright? I tried following the guide for my specific phone on the cyanogenmod wiki, using heimdall suite 1.4.0 i think  It fails and to solve it the wiki says that i have to compile the 1.4.1 from source which i cant figure out for the life of me. What am i doing wrong and/or what different method. Hi y'all, I am about to replace my phone which means I soon will have a spare phone to tinker with. While I've been flashing roms left and right since my HTC G1 (actually from before that even, when Windows Mobile was still a thing 0.o), I've always been interested in learning how to create (and I guess initially port) a custom rom - but the main reason why I didn't is because I always only had one phone which, wasn't very convenient if I would break it. I'm wondering if anyone could point. 
I have a OnePlus One, bought it second hand in July. Factory reset the phone when I got it, and I've never been able to install any system updates. It comes up saying update is available, then I download it. When I hit install, the phone reboots into something called Teamwin Recovery. I've tried googling where to find the update (Android/data/com.cyngn.fota) which then has cache and files (the update appears to be in cache? Not sure), but clicking on the file doesn't work, I get error 7. Tried. Hello everyone! I've flashed this morning the cm12.1 20150423 nightly on my OPO and I was stuck with a bootloop every time on the "optimizing apps" screen. Researching online I saw that it was because I needed to reflash the gapps, so instead of downloading it from the gapps wiki page of cyanogenmod I installed the gapps mini package from here (  After that I solved the bootloop problem but I can't use my phone. So, I was trying to install this using the instructions at get.cm, and I keep getting an "Unsupported Firmware" error. I managed to find manual installation instructions for the Nexus 5 on the Cyanogenmod Wiki, but I'm not exactly tech savvy, and I don't understand most of the terms there, and I don't really care to, to be honest. I just want to check it out and see for myself what the fuss is abou. My OS version is 5.0, if it's any help. Thanks. Had the WF Swift for 24 hours and have rooted. I've read in a few forums that updating to CM13 led to other problems (one being battery life). Is it worth it? I would be following the instructions at Cyanogenmod wiki (https://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Install_CM_for_crackling) with a custom rom, so it wouldn't be the usual OTA update. Any recommendations. Basically title. Official requirement is 4.4, reddit FAQ states 4.3, and I heard rumors it's possible for even lower version. Is there anyone technically qualified to tell me if it's possible to run it on Android 4.2.2? And maybe even how to? EDIT: I just installed a custom Android 4.4.4 Cyanogenmod ROM and it works fine for me. I recommend this solution as it's really easy to reinstall system for Android. EDIT2: Stop messaging me, I won't help any of you upgrade your system. I am a newbie and I think this can be a good project. There is a basic guide on the cyanogenmod wiki which is meant to help in starting to port for a new device. Wanted to know if anyone is already in to this type of thing as a hobby. Hi, I'm looking to try this out as a first timer to CM (I recently bought a Zenfone 3 so I'll be using my older Zenfone 2 to try out CM). I'm finding the standard Asus package to be a bit bloat heavy with redundant apps/unnecessary third party apps. I am planning to use the guide on the Cyanogenmod wiki; https://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Install_CM_for_Z00L Has anyone else found the install process relatively straightforward (and what else should So I have a sprint gs3 and a while back I put CM11 on it using the step by step instructions on the cyanogenmod wiki (heimdall, clockwork recovery, etc) but I want to update to CM12, but am wondering if I can do it without a computer so I don't have to reinstall all the different programs. I downloaded the cm12 zip on my phone. If I just boot into CW recovery and install the zip will that work? Or do I still have to wipe my device and everything because the cyanogenmod wiki page with instructio. Hi all! My OPO should be arriving tomorrow and I'm excited to start setting it up. I went to the Cyanogenmod wiki to read up on the features. It left me wondering a few things. Is the version of CM that is on the OPO the same as any other version. Or did OnePlus modify it in any way? So I see there is a wifi hotspot and tethering built in to CM. Can I use this regardless of my carrier's restrictions? I'll be on T-Mobile in the US and I'm supposed to have unlimited 
Hey guys, like some other guys i get gapps crashes every fucking second (youtube, gmail, ). i flashed the gapps 5.1 package from cyanogenmod wiki, wiped cache and dalvik and restart (3 times!) then i tried to install the full PA package from xda. but im not able to install it ("not compatible with your gapps") so is there any gapps full package working on cyanogenmod. edit 4: Yay, succeeded in flashing the custom recovery and cyanogen. Now to do google apps. I got a galaxy tab 2 7.0 from my grandparents. It is a Chinese version, so it doesn't have google play and it doesn't sync with google. It only has Samsung apps and some samsung account syncing. I want it to be able to do all that google good stuff so I searched around on reddit etc. and: I have heard around that I should root, flash a custom ROM (I guess cyanogenmod), flash gApps, and I'll be good. Quick question, checking wiki here - it says you have to root your phone to install cyanogenmod. However, if I go to cyanogenmod wiki - it says you dont: gt Do I need to root my phone before installing? gtNo. You can have a rooted phone, or not. The installer doesn't care. However, to be in a supported configuration, you need to be running a stock ROM . Can someone clarify then, whether rooting is necessary I have been following the Cyanogenmod Wiki Page ( trying to install cyanogenmod on my HTC Hero 200 CDMA. In the "Installing a Custom Recovery Image", using the Amon_Ra's Recovery method section, it instructs me to "Open the Terminal and navigate to the Android SDK Tools folder" ( (Step 5). The following gray-backed commands make me assume

I'm trying to flash CM12.1 onto my XT1064, but I'm unable to install a custom recovery. I'm following the official guide on Cyanogenmod's wiki, and I've unlocked my bootloader and have all the drivers. I've tried to get TWRP and CWM as a recovery, but to no success. I added the files to the fastboot folder, and using command prompt as admin when I try to add it an error pops up saying "cannot load filename." I've looked online for solutions, but haven't found anything yet. Any help is appreciate. Hello everyone!
